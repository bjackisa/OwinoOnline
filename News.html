                <h3>Why Owino Online?</h3>
                <q>By: Jackisa Daniel Barack</q>
                <p>More than 60 per cent of most second hand products traded in Uganda is from St. Balikudembe Market alias Owino Market. That is why more than half of this number is picking more interest in the online market place in solidarity to the closed Market during Lockdown.</p>
                <p>Sprawling around Nakivubo Stadium, Owino has everything from traditional medicines to televisions. It’s most famous for its secondhand clothing, but you can also buy cloth to be tailored on-site. It's possible to spend hours here, not least because it’s so hard to find your way out. Watch your belongings.

                <p>More About Owino Actual Market?</p>
                <p>Location
                <br />
                St Balikuddembe Market is shares a boundary with Nakivubo Stadium and is within working distance of the tax and bus terminals. It is in the centre of the central business of Kampala City.
                <br>
                History of the Market
                <br />
                St Balikuddembe market was started in 1971 with 320 vendors who were reallocated by Kampala City Council from Nakasero Market to this site. The City Council named the new market; Municipal Market which was later renamed by vendors to Owino Market after an old man called Owino whom the vendors found on the site roasting maize and sweet potatoes. The market started as a whole sale market for farmers produce with aim of supplying other markets in Kampala and surrounding areas. Over time the market has diversified into other lines of business to include garments, shoes, scrap, cooked food, chicken and meat.

                Description of the Market
                <br>
                The initial structures of Owino market were made of papyrus, which were replaced by iron sheets before permanent structures were built. Owino, which is the biggest open market in Uganda and possibly in East Africa is built on 7.04 hectares of land with time, it has became overcrowded, forcing some of the vendors to move out to the expansive parking yard belonging to Nakivubo War Memorial Stadium.
                <br>
                Population in the Market
                <br>
                The vendors and traders are in excess of 50,000 vendors, 70% of whom are women.  At least 300,000 customers visit   the market on a daily basis and the number of customers increases over the weekend and a few days before a public holiday.
                <br>
